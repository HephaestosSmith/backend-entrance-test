# Backend Engineer Practical Test — Plugin-based Message Processing System

This repository contains a practical test for backend engineer candidates.  
The goal is to evaluate architecture design, TypeScript proficiency, API design, and extensibility thinking.

---

## 📌 Overview

Please implement a **plugin-based message processing system** using **TypeScript**.  
The system should accept different types of messages and dispatch them to the correct handler based on the message type.

**Note:**
• You can use any package manager (npm, yarn, bun, pnpm, etc.)
• If you're not familiar with TypeScript, you may use JavaScript instead (though TypeScript is preferred)

Example message:

```json
{
  "type": "email",
  "payload": {
    "to": "test@example.com",
    "subject": "Hello",
    "body": "World"
  }
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Email sent successfully",
  "data": {
    "messageId": "msg-123",
    "status": "sent"
  }
}
```

The system must support at least:

• email
• sms

Future message types (e.g., LINE, Slack, Webhook) should be easy to add without modifying core logic.

---

## Requirements

### 1. API

Implement a POST endpoint:

**POST /messages**

Request Body:

```json
{
  "type": "email" | "sms",
  "payload": { ... }
}
```

• Accepts { type, payload }
• Dispatches to the correct handler
• Returns the handler's result
• Should return appropriate HTTP status codes (200 for success, 400 for bad request, 404 for unknown message type, 500 for server errors)

Framework is free to choose:

• Express
• Fastify
• NestJS
• Or native Node.js HTTP

---

### 2. Plugin Architecture

You must implement:

**MessageHandler interface (or abstract class)**

Defines:

• `type: string`
• `handle(payload: any): Promise<any> | any`

**Handlers**

Implement at least:

• EmailHandler
• SmsHandler

Each handler must implement the MessageHandler interface.

**MessageProcessor**

Responsible for:

• Registering handlers
• Mapping type → handler
• Dispatching messages
• Handling unknown types

---

### 3. Code Structure

Your code should be organized into modules, for example:

```text
src/
  handlers/
    email.handler.ts
    sms.handler.ts
  processor/
    message-processor.ts
  routes/
    messages.route.ts
  index.ts
```

Database is not required.
All data may be stored in memory.

**Note**: You should include:
• `package.json` with all dependencies
• `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration
• `.gitignore` file
• Clear instructions in README for setup and running

---

## Bonus Points (Optional)

These are not required but will be considered a plus:

• Use of TypeScript features (interface, type, enum, generics)
• Dependency Injection or factory pattern
• Async handler support (simulate external API calls with delays)
• Input validation (Zod, class-validator, etc.)
• Comprehensive error handling (400/404/500 with meaningful error messages)
• Unit tests (Jest / Vitest) with good coverage
• Dynamic plugin loading (scan folder automatically)
• Logging (console.log is acceptable, but structured logging is a plus)
• Consistent error response format
• Type-safe payloads (using TypeScript types/interfaces instead of `any`)

## Evaluation Criteria

| Category              | Weight        | What We Look For                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Architecture          | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐     | Clear layering, extensibility, abstraction          |
| TypeScript Proficiency| ⭐⭐⭐⭐       | Proper use of types, interfaces, enums              |
| Code Readability      | ⭐⭐⭐⭐       | Naming, structure, comments                         |
| Error Handling        | ⭐⭐⭐         | Graceful handling of invalid input                  |
| API Design            | ⭐⭐⭐         | RESTful, consistent responses                       |
| AI Usage Strategy     | ⭐⭐           | Ability to refine AI output, not copy blindly       |
| Tests (Optional)      | ⭐⭐           | Basic unit tests                                    |

## Submission

**Please fork this repository and submit a Pull Request (PR) when you've completed the implementation.**

Please provide:

• A GitHub repository link (make sure it's public or accessible)
• Clear instructions to run the project (including Node.js version requirement, if any)
• `package.json` with all necessary scripts (e.g., `npm start`, `npm run dev`)
• (Optional) Notes on design decisions and trade-offs
• (Optional) Brief explanation of your architecture choices

---

## Time Limit

You have **1 hour** to complete the implementation.

**Important Notes:**
• You may use AI tools to assist, but you should understand and be able to explain your code
• Focus on core functionality first, then add bonus features if time permits
• Code quality and architecture are more important than feature completeness
• Make sure the code compiles and runs without errors

---

Good luck, and have fun building!
